HLCP - Highlight Copier

HLCP (Highlight Copier) is a Windows application that automatically copies highlighted text from any application (e.g., text editors, browsers) into the clipboard. It runs in the background with a system tray icon and can be terminated easily.
Features

    Automatically copies selected text to the clipboard without requiring manual Ctrl+C.
    Runs silently in the system tray.
    Simple and lightweight.
    Easy termination via the system tray menu.

Requirements

    Operating System: Windows (10/11 recommended)
    Go Version: 1.20+ (for building the application)

Installation
Precompiled Executable

    Download the precompiled HLCP.exe file from the Releases section.
    Place the executable in your desired directory.
    Run the program to start monitoring clipboard activity.

Build from Source

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HLCP.git
cd HLCP

Ensure you have Go installed. Then, build the executable:

    go build -ldflags="-H windowsgui" -o HLCP.exe main.go

    Run the HLCP.exe file to start the program.

Usage

    Start the program by running HLCP.exe.
    Highlight any text in a supported application (e.g., text editor, browser).
    The text will be automatically copied to the clipboard.
    Access the system tray icon for options:
        Quit: Exits the application and removes the icon from the tray.

System Tray Icon

The application displays an icon in the system tray while running. The icon provides quick access to the "Quit" option.
How It Works

HLCP uses Windows API calls to:

    Monitor the system clipboard.
    Simulate the Ctrl+C command when text is selected, ensuring it is copied to the clipboard.
